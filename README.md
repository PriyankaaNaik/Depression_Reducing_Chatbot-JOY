# Depression_Reducing_Chatbot-JOY
The chatbot 'JOY' is developed for all those individuals who are going through anxiety and depression issues due to numerous aspects. The main focus of this project was not only to create a positive chatbot that helps to reduce the depression and stress from the users, but also to create a very useful and effective dataset that could be useful for future researchers, and they could then develop it more to really make a difference in the mental health sector. This chatbot is using a natural language processing method to understand the user inputs also it is trained on deep neural network techniques to give more efficient results. Keeping in mind a scenario, that in the future if this project is used by a person undergoing such problems, who are feeling stressed, who needs someone to talk to, who wants to share everything thatâ€™s there in his or her mind, may find this chatbot JOY very useful, positive and friendly. A lot of development is needed in the future, but overall it can be concluded that JOY may substitute a therapist temporarily if needed. The dataset used in this project is created manually in a JSON format and can be expanded further in the future. This project is developed in Google Colab and can be executed in Jupyter Notebook as well.
